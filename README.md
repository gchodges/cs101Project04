# CS101 Project 4
The purpose of this project was to become confortable with using hash tables to store data. For the project, we had to uplement a hash table class and store data to the hash table. We also had to create both a print and lookup function.

# Hash Table
We were to use a hash table with Quadratic probing and a pre-defined hash function, djb2, that turned a string into an uint64_t. We then used the quadratic probing function (hashKey + j + jxj) for collision resolution. We were to identify a key in command line arguments and store a list of people at the hash index.

# Print Function
The print function entailed printing the whole hash table along with the hash index.

# Lookup Function
The lookup function involved printing all people of a ser identified key in the order that they appeared in the input file.
